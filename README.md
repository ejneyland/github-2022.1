## This is a subheading
### So on and so forth
This is just regular ol' paragraph text
1. Look!
2. These are numbered
3. How bout it

- Can even do dot points
- if you fancy

\# if you want to start with a hash but not make a heading use a \ before the #

Blank lines are required below each paragraph
in order for it to be

recognised as a new paragraph

**double astrix** before and after text will make the font bold
